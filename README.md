# Phantomaton Stability Adapter üå†

The Phantomaton Stability Adapter allows the Phantomaton AI to generate images using the Stability AI API, bringing your wildest text prompts to life!

## Installation üîÆ

To install this plugin, use the following incantation:

```
npm install phantomaton-stability
```

## Usage üï∏Ô∏è

To unleash the power of Stability AI image generation within [Phantomaton](https://github.com/phantomaton-ai/phantomaton), simply install the module in your system prompt:

```markdown
/install(module:phantomaton-stability)
```

### Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

The Stability Adapter requires an API key to access the Stability AI API. You can obtain an API key from [https://platform.stability.ai/](https://platform.stability.ai/).

You can configure the API key and home directory (where generated images are stored) in `.phantomaton/configuration.json`:

```
{
 "phantomaton-stability": {
   "apiKey": "YOUR_STABILITY_API_KEY",
   "home": "path/to/images"
 }
}
```

**Note:** Replace `YOUR_STABILITY_API_KEY` with your actual Stability AI API key.

### Using the `imagine` Command

Once the adapter is installed and configured, your assistant will have access to the `imagine` command:

```markdown
/imagine(project:my-project, file:image.png) {
  A cat riding a unicorn
} imagine!
```

This will generate an image based on the prompt "A cat riding a unicorn" and save it to `image.png` in the `my-project` project.
